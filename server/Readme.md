# Mapbox Glyphserver

This project serves glyphs (fonts and symbols) requested by mapbox like clients. These clients request glyphs as:

https://servername/glyphserverpath/Font%20Family%20A,Font%20Family%20B,Font%20Family%20N/range.pbf

This (very simple) server searches for the available range file in the order of the given font names and streams the first one found if available.
